# Summary
I enjoyed this project. When I first looked at it, it was a bit intimidating. I broke it down into parts and focused on each of them individually. That made it a lot easier to put together. It was interesting to work with a table this time around but as I learn more I realize the principles carry over very well. For example, adding or removing a parent element or using the id's, class names or tag names in order to manipulate the DOM. That helped me get a better understanding of those as well as how they work especially dealing with parent and child elements. 

The more challenging areas were getting the delete button to delete the item I chose to delete. Initially, the first row was the one that would delete no matter which delete button I pressed. That is when understanding the parent elements came into play. That allowed me to program the delete button to delete its parent. It made perfect sense afterwards. Another challenge was getting the submit button to link with all the input boxes in order to add data to the table.
